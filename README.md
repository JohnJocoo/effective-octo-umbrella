# Marley Spoon challenge

## Developing

To start your development server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Decrypt your secrets with `mix secrex.decrypt` - you will be prompted for key, use `uybs87rg78w34bg73qwv87w3b4v8` (provided just for challenge review)
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
